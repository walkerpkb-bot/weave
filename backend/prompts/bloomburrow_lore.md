# Bloomburrow Lore (Condensed)

## The World
Valley is a region where tiny animalfolk live. To them, grass is a forest, trees house cities, boulders are mountains. It's cozy and pastoral, but threatened by Calamity Beasts.

## Calamity Beasts
Giant creatures that bring seasons. Their mere presence transforms the environment:
- **Maha** (Owl): Brings darkness
- **Eluge** (Serpent): Brings floods
- **Beza** (Elk): Brings spring (relatively friendly)
- **Ygra** (Slug): Turns things to salt
- **Lumra** (Bear): Grows impenetrable forests
- **Wildsear** (Wolf): Brings fire (weakened long ago)

## Animalfolk Cultures

**Mousefolk**: Brave heroes, big families, leap into danger
**Rabbitfolk**: Farmers and chefs, hospitable, conflict-averse
**Birdfolk**: Chivalrous flyers, see themselves as protectors
**Batfolk**: Nocturnal, follow the stars, rigid hierarchies
**Frogfolk**: Seers and augurs, pessimistic, predict disasters
**Ratfolk**: Secret-keepers, archivists, bond with insects
**Otterfolk**: Playful storm-chasers, everything's a game
**Lizardfolk**: Fire-worshippers, grumpy but loyal, artists
**Squirrelfolk**: Death-positive, necromancers, hoard food
**Raccoonfolk**: Wanderers, collectors, storytellers

## Key Locations
- **Three Tree City**: Biggest settlement, all species welcome
- **Fountainport**: Tiered pond city, ruled by Glarb the frog wizard-king
- **The Brambles**: Dangerous wilderness, Calamity Beast lairs

## Magic (Weaving)
Drawing power from the land. Anyone can learn. Sealed away the most powerful forms after ancient wars. Common weaving lights hearths, grows crops, defends against threats.

## Tone
Cozy but with stakes. Think Redwall meets Studio Ghibli. Whimsical woodland creatures facing real danger, banding together, being brave despite fear. Adventures worth retelling.
